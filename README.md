# Tic-Tac-Toe
 Basic implementation in Java

 The game is played by using the numerical keyboard.
 
 Chosing a square for placing X or O is done by presing one 
 of the buttons on the numerical keyboard:

   7  |  8  |  9
  --- + --- + ---
   4  |  5  |  6
  --- + --- + ---
   1  |  2  |  3 

 in example, pressing 7 results in:

   X  |     |    
  --- + --- + ---
      |     |   
  --- + --- + ---
      |     |    

 pressing 2 results in:

   X  |     |    
  --- + --- + ---
      |     |   
  --- + --- + ---
      |  O  |    

 And so on...
